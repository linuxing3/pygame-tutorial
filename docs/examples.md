# Example code and programs

There are many example programs available for download at:
http://ProgramArcadeGames.com/python_examples/en/python_examples.zip

Here is a brief description of what is available:

## 1.1 Text examples
Example programs that don't involve graphics:

### Program that calculates miles-per-gallon.
`calculate_miles_per_gallon.py`

### Calculates the kinetic energy of an object.
`calculate_kinetic_energy.py`

### Simple example if statements.
`if_statement_examples.py`

### Simple example for loops.
`for_loop_examples.py`

### Simple example while loops. (Chapter 4
`while_loop_examples.py`

### Simple example for encrypting text.
`simple_encryption.py`

### Simple example for decrypting text.
`simple_decryption.py`

### Binary and linear searches.
`searching_example.py`

### Property check examples.
`property_check_examples.py`

## 1.2 Graphics examples
Programs that show how to use graphics:

### This opens up a blank pygame window. It is a good template to use when starting a new program.
`pygame_base_template.py`

### This file demonstrates setting up a window and drawing rectangles, polygons, text, and other basic shapes.
`simple_graphics_demo.py`

### See how to rotate text.
`text_rotate.py`

### Demos all the commands in the draw module.
`draw_module_example.py`

### Animate a bouncing rectangle around the screen.
`bouncing_rectangle.py`

### Animate a several bouncing balls.
`bouncing_balls.py`

### This shows how to use an array to animate and track multiple objects. In this case, snow flakes.
`animating_snow.py`

This file draws a snowman inside of a function. The program can then call the draw snowman function and draw several snowmen ### easily.
`functions_and_graphics.py`

### Move an object with the mouse.
`move_mouse.py`

### Move an object with the keyboard.
`move_keyboard.py`

### Move an object with the game controller.
`move_game_controller.py`

### Show how to read everything off a gamepad/controller/joystick.
`joystick_calls.py`

### Display bitmapped images (png, jpg) to a screen. Make sounds.
`bitmapped_graphics.py`

Display a board based on a two-dimensional grid. Useful when creating games like tic-tac-toe, minesweeper, memory-match, ### connect-four, etc.
`array_backed_grid.py`

### Display one or more pages of instruction before the game starts.
`instruction_screen.py`

Plays background music. When the music is over, an event is triggered and a different song starts. The music is included in the ### downloadable zip file, or you can follow the links in the comments to download the music.
`background_music.py`

### Shows how to display a centered "Game Over" message, and stop game play when a game is over.
`game_over.py`

### Display a line sweeping around in a circle like a radar.
`radar_sweep.py`

### Count up and count down timers.
`timer.py`

### Using recursion to make nested rectangles.
`recursive_rectangles.py`

### Using recursion to make fractals.
`fractal.py`

### Put a timer on the screen.
`timer.py`

## 1.3 Sprite examples

How to use sprites:

### Move a sprite with the mouse and collect blocks.
`sprite_collect_blocks.py`

### Same as collect blocks example, but all the sprites move.
`moving_sprites.py`

### Same as collect blocks example, but you can move the sprite by clicking to pick them up.
`pick_up_blocks.py`

### Rather than just move down, these sprites bounce.
`moving_sprites_bounce.py`

### Prior example too boring? Get the sprites to move in circles.
`sprite_circle_movement.py`

### Expands the prior example to show how to manage a game with levels. Level advances when all the blocks are cleared.
`sprite_collect_blocks_levels.py`
### 
Same as `sprite_collect_blocks.py`
###  but with a black circle instead of a block.
`sprite_collect_circle.py`
### 
Same as `sprite_collect_blocks.py`
###  but with a graphic instead of a block.
`sprite_collect_graphic.py`
### 
Same as `sprite_collect_blocks.py`
###  but with a graphic instead of a block.
`sprite_rotating.py`
### 
Same idea as `sprite_collect_blocks.py`
 but uses a Game class to organize the code. This is a more advanced way of organizing the code. It helps if you want to ### “restart” a game once it is over.
`game_class_example.py`

### Move a sprite around the screen with the mouse.
`move_sprite_mouse.py`

### Move a sprite with the keyboard in discrete “jumps.”
`move_sprite_keyboard_jump.py`

### Move a sprite with the keyboard smoothly and continuously while a key is pressed.
`move_sprite_keyboard_smooth.py`

### Move a sprite with a game controller or joystick.
`move_sprite_game_controller.py`

### Basic Pong game using two game controllers.
`pong.py`

### How to manage bullets with sprites.
`bullets.py`

### How to aim bullets.
`bullets_aimed.py`

### Control a snake as it moves around the screen.
`snake.py`

## 1.4 Platformer examples
Progressively more complex examples for a platformer game:

### Move a sprite around the screen, but not let it move through walls.
`move_with_walls_example.py`

### More complex version of prior example, with multi-colored walls, and multiple rooms.
`maze_runner.py`

### Get the player to jump off platforms.
`platform_jumper.py`

### Like platform jumper, but scroll side to side.
`platform_scroller.py`

### Make those platforms move!
`platform_moving.py`

A multi-file example that shows a platformer using sprite sheets.
